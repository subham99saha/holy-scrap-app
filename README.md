# E-commerce Price Comparer

This is a software for comparing prices across e-commerce platforms. It fetches all products for a given search query from various sites like _Amazon_, _Flipkart_, _Myntra_, and _AJIO_ into a single list for comparison. 

It is built using React, Node, and Electron JS. Future plans include adding interface for faster access to _latest reviews_, and the introduction of more platforms like _Nykaa_, _Meesho_, _Blinkit_, _Zepto_, and _Instamart_

Will write more with progress in development. For now here are some snaps from the application.
